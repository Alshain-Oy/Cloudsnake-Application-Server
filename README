Cloudsnake Application Server

Quick Overview

 - CAPS (= Cloudsnake APplication Server ) is a conceptual hybrid of Python and Erlang.

 - With CAPS you can execute python functions using JSON-RPC interface over HTTP.

 - Python code is loaded into CAPS and compiled in realtime. CAPS compiles the code and extracts all code artifacts ( functions and classes ) and registers them to the JSON-RPC call interface.

 - All artifacts can be reloaded during runtime i.e. you can fix bugs and just send the new version to the server and it is transparently switched with the older one.

 - CAPS also incorporates a memory based persistent key value store that stays between function calls. You can update your code without having to re-enter all data.

 - A HTTP POST interface is served to outer world with JSON-RPC.

 - All code inside CAPS is sandboxed for security reasons.

 - All function calls are threaded so they can be run parallel.

*Super quick example*:

python cloudSnake.py

(using different terminal)
python clients/add_code.py main code_examples/caps_test_funcs.py
python clients/get_rss_feed.py
